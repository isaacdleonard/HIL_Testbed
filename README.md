FSU-CAPS Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed Repository

This repository is primarily intended for real-time RSCAD models of power systems that are being used for research by the FREEDM Systems Center. FSU-CAPS plans for this repository to provide version control and documentation history of the published models for center-wide benefit.
